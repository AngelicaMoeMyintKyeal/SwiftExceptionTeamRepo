## About The Project

Brainstorming about ideas can be fun but also troublesome sometimes. Our main goal is to help users brainstorm multiple ideas by selecting the desired words provided randomly with the definitions. 

Here in this application, user can swipe left or right to choose or reject the words randomly provided and create multiple ideas by their chosen words.

The information about the public `API` implemented in this project can found here -> [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev)
