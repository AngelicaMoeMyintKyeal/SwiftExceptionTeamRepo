## About The Project

Brainstorming about ideas can be fun but also troublesome sometimes. 

Our main goal is to help users brainstorm multiple ideas by choosing from the random word cards. To make it more fun, we have implmented an awesome animation that let users swipe right or left to choose or discard the word cards. 

In this project, we aim to create an application to meet this kind of specific need for users.

We have previously used an API to get the definitions of our random words but in our latest updates, only the words will be provided without the definitions.
The information about the public `API` implemented in this project can found here -> [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev)

Our project release schedule style will be one week sprint.

## Application Name
`
Idea Bank

## Application Description

Using our application, the user can swipe left or right to choose or reject the words randomly provided and create multiple ideas by their chosen words. User can also choose to save the ideas they want to store from their idea lists.
